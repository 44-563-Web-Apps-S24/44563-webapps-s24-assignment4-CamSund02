    <h3>The Proposal (Anton Pavlovich Chekhov)</h3>
    <p>
        LOMOV. The more so as I have evidence. My aunt's grandmother gave the
        land to your father's grandfather's peasants...
        
        NATALYA STEPANOVNA. Yes, yes, let that pass.... [Aside] I wish I knew
        how to get him started.... [Aloud] Are you going to start shooting soon?
        
        LOMOV. I'm thinking of having a go at the blackcock, honoured Natalya
        Stepanovna, after the harvest. Oh, have you heard? Just think, what a
        misfortune I've had! My dog Guess, whom you know, has gone lame.
        
        NATALYA STEPANOVNA. What a pity! Why?
        
        LOMOV. I don't know.... Must have got twisted, or bitten by some other
        dog.... [Sighs] My very best dog, to say nothing of the expense. I gave
        Mironov 125 roubles for him.
        
        NATALYA STEPANOVNA. It was too much, Ivan Vassilevitch.
        
        LOMOV. I think it was very cheap. He's a first-rate dog.
