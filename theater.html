        <h4>LOMOV.</h4>
        <p>
        The more so as I have evidence. My aunt's grandmother gave the
        land to your father's grandfather's peasants...
        </p>

        <h4>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</h4>
        <p>
        Yes, yes, let that pass.... 
        <p>[Aside]</p>
        I wish I knew
        how to get him started....
        <p>[Aloud]</p>
        Are you going to start shooting soon?
        </p>

        <h4>LOMOV.</h4>
        <p>
        I'm thinking of having a go at the blackcock, honoured Natalya
        Stepanovna, after the harvest. Oh, have you heard? Just think, what a
        misfortune I've had! My dog Guess, whom you know, has gone lame.
        </p>

        <h4>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</h4>
        <p>
        What a pity! Why?
        </p>
        
        <h4>LOMOV.</h4>
        <p>
        I don't know.... Must have got twisted, or bitten by some other
        dog.... 
        <p>
        [Sighs]
        </p>
        My very best dog, to say nothing of the expense. I gave
        Mironov 125 roubles for him.
        </p>

        <h4>NATALYA STEPANOVNA.</h4>
        <p>
        It was too much, Ivan Vassilevitch.
        </p>

        <h4>LOMOV.</h4>
        <p>
        I think it was very cheap. He's a first-rate dog.
